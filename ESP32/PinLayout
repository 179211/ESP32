OLED
Controller ic: SSD1306, SSD1331
The most suitable pins for I2C communication in the ESP32 are GPIO 22 (SCL) and GPIO 21 (SDA).
If youâ€™re using an OLED display with SPI communication protocol, use the following GPIOs.

GPIO  4: CE
GPIO  5: CSN
GPIO 18: CLK/SCK
GPIO 19: MISO
GPIO 23: MOSI
GPIO 21: SDA
GPIO 22: SCL clock

  Label  	  GPIO  	  Safe to use?  	Reason
D0	0		must be HIGH during boot and LOW for flashing
TX0	1		Tx pin, used for flashing and debugging
D2	2		must be LOW during boot, cannot be used when microSD card is present
RX0	3		Rx pin, used for flashing and debugging
D4	4		Connected to the on-board Flash LED, cannot be used when microSD card is present
D12	12		must be LOW during boot, cannot be used when microSD card is present
D13	13		cannot be used when microSD card is present
D14	14		cannot be used when microSD card is present
D15	15		must be HIGH during boot, prevents startup log if pulled LOW, cannot be used when microSD card is present
